Brewski was an app written in SWIFT 5 that targeting the latest iOS version -> 13.2. It was built for a coding task.br/>
The brief is outlined below:
##### Project Requirements:
- Using the BreweryDB API, create an iOS application to list beers from the API.
- The web application should be written in Swift using Xcode, targeting the latest version of the iOS SDK (13).
- API docs: https://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs ~ has since been retired
- Sandbox URL: https://sandbox-api.brewerydb.com/v2/
- Sandbox API key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- The user should be able to search the list of beers and see a paged list.
- The user should be able to click on the beer for more information.
To show a bit of flare I added a device shake gesture that spawned extra beer bubbles that slowly dissapated - resembelling a real beer!
